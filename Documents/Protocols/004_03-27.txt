  short clear description, use issues from project site). 

2. Reports (15 min)

No issues so far.

3. Discussion items (35 min) 

  (a) How do we do...? 

How do we implement MVC using Slick2D?

	Each module (player, enemy or object) has its own controller with a view and model. 
We will have one main controller who initialises each module controller. 

For example: The player controller takes the input from the keys and sends it to the model. 

The update loop - will be found in the main controller. The update-function will delegate to the other controler to run. Then the controller tells the model to update it’s gamestate.


4. Outcomes and assignments (5 min) 

Everyone should look in the RAD and SDD and write something on their own, we will then come together and wrap it up and complete things that hasn’t been written.



5. Wrap up
