Meeting Agenda

  Date: 05-12

  Facilitator: Adam Waldenberg

  Participants: Ivar Josefsson, Andre Samuelsson, Anna Nylander, Alma Ottedag

1. Objectives (5 min) 
Syncronize and make sure everyone has work to do. Everyone should have an idea on how things have been done and a basic idea of coming implementations.  


2. Reports (15 min) 

Anna has solved the XML-reading issue and its now working properly.

Ivar has been somewhat stuck on the networking part, some hard to solve buggs that are now out of the way hindered progress. 

André and Alma has refactored the project so that updated are made from the controllers and not the whole model at once.

André has been working on doors and realized that we don’t need more plugins for all interactive objects, it creates more problems than it solves.


3. Discussion items (35 min) 

We are keeping a high pace but we still have a lot that needs to be done. The project is picking up speed again. 

Continued work is needed on networking.

We should look into having several rooms and setting up a proper map. 

4. Outcomes and assignments (5 min) 

Everyone: Tests!! We need at least 99% coverage!! + pmd+findbugs
Ivar: Keeps working on networking
Anna & André: Implementation of several rooms
Anna & André: Fix xml and plugin. (We want to be able to a new monster without recompiling the whole project) //TODO: fix so player’s position is loaded from the map.
Alma : Implement more advanced plugins (move boxes, speak with someone, all the fun things we wanted to do… <3)
