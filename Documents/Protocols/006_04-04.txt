Meeting Agenda

  Date: 04-04 14:40

  Facilitator: Adam Waldenberg

  Participants: Anna Nylander, Alma Ottedag, Ivar Josefsson, André Samuelsson

1. Objectives (5 min) 
Fine tuning the maven repository. Especially for André because everyone else has got the program working.
We also need to decide where to go from the first iteration. 

2. Reports (15 min) From previous meetings, (un)solved issues, 

The documentation has been improved and the SDD has been created and implemented.

Everyone has helped creating the new core of the application, especially in terms of refactorisation.

We have succeeded in creating a running program with a simple yet concise code structure.

We still need to create a sequence diagram over the application.

The communication within the group is still in need of improvement but has gone through positive changes since the start of iteration one.


3. Discussion items (35 min) 

How do we construct iteration two?
First off we’re going to divied future iterations in weeks. From Friday to Friday.
To be done to this iteration:
What tileset should be used
Fix collision detection using interface instead of current hashmap
Fix area collision instead of point collision.
Very basic animations should be implemented. 
Implement Enemies, following the player as directly as possible, no attacks or damage. 

Add tests for parts of the model.4
Priority lies in adding npcs to a single room. 
(Consider movement patterns)

4. Outcomes and assignments (5 min) 

Anna & André: Tileset + animation, enemy movement patterns. At least one test class per person.

Alma & Ivar:  collision detection using interface & area collission detection. At least one testclass per person. Implementation of enemy: (AI) the view, any interfaces needed.

André & Ivar: Should fix test suite.

5. Wrap up 

Next meeting will be monday 07 april at about 16.00.
