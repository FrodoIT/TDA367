Apart from the last fix the game is ready to be written. Slick2D is implented and ready to be used. We have also created a preliminary UML which will be continously improved. 

We also developed the game theme, so that there is a clear setting for the game.

 Unfortunately the meeting last Sunday was not held, but the group solved several issues with implementing slick2d instead.


3. Discussion items (35 min) 

  (a) Setting up UML from the Use Cases?

  (b) Writing easy tests for the simple classes?

  (c) Writing the RAD 2.0-3?

Everyone will work together on this, until Thursday when the next meeting is to be held.
